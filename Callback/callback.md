What is a Callback Function?
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later, usually after some operation completes.

Why Use Callbacks?
Asynchronous Execution – Handles time-consuming operations like API calls or file reading.
Reusability – You can pass different functions as callbacks.
Avoiding Blocking Code – JavaScript is single-threaded, and callbacks help prevent delays
